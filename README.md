# cs1.6
An FPS game developed using Babylonjs.
The code is a bit (really) badly structred, but all the logic is there. So hopefuly if will be useful to someone looking for FPS howtos.
# Main Features:
Ray casting
Collision detection
Animations
HUD
Basic AI and Path finding (A*) with some kind of obstacle avoidance
A basic trick for a better performance for the path finding algorithms
Attaching meshes to bones
Pickups
Headshots (yeah)
Objects cashing
Mobile support (joystick camera)
Difficulty level simulation
Babylon files of the models extracted from CS 1.6
Some minor modification to babylonjs script to add nozzle flash and a custom loading screen
Full screen
Point lock
Player Health
Dynamic wall generation
Jump and crouch
Device Detection
Respawn
Continues enemy generation
Sounds
Shader material
Asset manager
In-game menu
The project uses 3.x version of babylonjs. I tried porting to 4.0 but got some issues animating the player.
All models were extracted from CS 1.6 and fixed using blender. I own nothing of them.
